# Lisp

A little lisp I made in Elixir that is still a WIP.
I aim to add some sort of distributed computing element to it (probably having
the lisp environments shared between all repl processes).

## Run it

At the moment it's easiest to just run it from iex.

```bash
iex -S mix
```

Then start the repl.

```elixir
Lisp.Repl.run
```
